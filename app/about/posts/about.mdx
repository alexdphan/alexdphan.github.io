I'm currently finishing my undergrad at George Mason University. 

I spend a lot of my time tinkering with new ideas and building things.

My primary interests lie in Fintech, Blockchain, and AI/ML, with a focus on SaaS and infrastructure solutions.

This summer, I'm working at [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/) in San Francisco. Feel free to [DM](https://x.com/alexdphan) if you'd like to chat!

Past Events:

- [Outlier Fellow](https://www.outliers.build/) at Floodgate
- [Modular Fellow](https://blog.celestia.org/introducing-modular-fellows/) at [Celestia](https://celestia.org/)
- First Analyst at [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
