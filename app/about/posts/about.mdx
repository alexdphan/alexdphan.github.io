I'm currently finishing my undergrad at George Mason University. 

I spend a lot of my time tinkering with new ideas and building things.

My primary interests are in Fintech, Blockchains, and AI/ML, focusing on SAAS and infrastructure solutions.

This summer, I'm working at Browserbase in San Francisco. Feel free to [DM me](https://x.com/alexdphan) if you'd like to chat!
