{/* I'm currently finishing my undergrad while working full-time.  */}

I spend a lot of my time tinkering and building new ideas I find interesting.

{/* My primary interests lie in Fintech, Blockchains, and AI/ML, with a focus on SaaS and infrastructure solutions. */}

I'm also the first growth engineer at [Browserbase](https://www.browserbase.com/), an exciting startup in San Francisco.
