An app that can create group chats on a map...

<div className="overflow-hidden py-5 flex justify-center">
  <Image
    src="/images/mapchat.png"
    width={250}
    height={100}
    className="rounded-lg"
  />
</div>
<br />

I know right, horrible idea. But it was during covid and I wanted to create a platform that could help people stay connected during the pandemic.

Also, it was the first project that gave me a taste of the startup world.

During the process, I grew a discord server to 12000+ members.

<div className="overflow-hidden py-5 flex justify-center">
  <Image
    src="/images/server.png"
    width={300}
    height={100}
    className="rounded-lg"
  />
</div>
<br />

**Lessons learned:**

- If you can't develop something real quick over a weekend, youâ€™ll lose momentum over time
- Be aware of the culture in your team
- Delegate jobs to people that considers them strengths
- Get product market fit :/
