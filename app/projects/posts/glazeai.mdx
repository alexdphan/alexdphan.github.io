I wanted to find the most absurd way to congratulate my college friends on their graduation.

Built it real quick, while also learning and experimenting with new developer tools.

Although it didn't solve a "problem", it was something I wanted out on the internet.

Why? I have no idea lol.

Lesson Learned:

- Projects don't always need to "solve" a problem, just do it because it's fun
- Using infra tooling is easier than you think
- People often use the product without showing clear signals of their usage, which can be overlooked in the process of capturing the user flow.
