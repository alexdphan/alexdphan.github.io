A platform for artists, creators, and brands to create and manage a community of supporters through *subscriptions*.

**Lessons learned:**

- Ensure there is a clear vision, problem, and solution
- In-person communication is always better, you can’t beat real-life collaboration
- It’s important to set priorities and recognize your abilities to determine what to implement within a product/protocol
