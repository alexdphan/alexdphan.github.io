## A dashboard that can host all third-party tooling specifically for DAOs

Rough designed on a weekend

Team built the mvp in one day

Was able to work with some awesome people

After a couple customer interviews, we decided that the solution and problem was unclear

Looking back, this made me cringe..

<div className="overflow-hidden py-5">

    height={500}
    layout="responsive"
    width={100}
    height={100}
    objectFit="cover"
    className="rounded-lg"
  />
</div>
*Initial Design Concept*
