Welcome! Thanks for visiting.

I'm currently finishing my undergrad at George Mason University.

I'm also an [Outlier Fellow](https://www.outliers.build/) and spending my free time practical deep learning.

In the past, I served as a [Modular Fellow](https://blog.celestia.org/introducing-modular-fellows/) at [Celestia](https://celestia.org/), was the first Analyst at [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), worked in marketing at [Index Coop](https://indexcoop.com/), and ran as Admin at [Odyssey](https://www.cryptostudyhall.xyz/).
