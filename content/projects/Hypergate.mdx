Rough designed on a weekend

Team built the mvp in one day

Was able to work with some awesome people

After a couple customer interviews, we decided that the solution and problem was unclear

This idea may be reintroduced as I continue to be more involved within DAOs

Look back, this is cringe..

Lessons:

- Prepare for better team management
- Decsion making is crucial
- Being technical can help
