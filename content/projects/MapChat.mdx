I know right, horrible idea.

But it was first project that got me into startups in the first place.

Still grew a discord server to 13000+ members though..

**Lessons learned:**

- If you can't develop something real quick over a weekend, youâ€™ll lose momentum over time
- Be aware of the culture in your team
- Delegate jobs to people that considers them strengths
- Get product market fit :/
