Small twitter thread I made on some lessons I’ve learned:

[At 18, I cold-called 300+ local US business owners and directed more online traffic for them](https://twitter.com/alexdphan/status/1440724029027938304?s=20&t=GaCdU6gRvfEuhV8Wgoi5ow)

Still remember the days I would jump out of the pool in the middle of teaching swim lessons to pick up sales calls... good times.

- Contacted over 300 United States corporations and secured 40 partnerships
- Managed an employee to oversee the company’s website
- Generated over $10,000 MRR

Lessons learned:
- Do not delegate if it's not necessary
- Look at the numbers (but don't get too invested in them)
- Customer service is a major component in good user experience
